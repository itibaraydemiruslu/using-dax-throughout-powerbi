## Using DAX throughout Power BI to Create Robust Data Scenarios

This project is part of a guided course available on Coursera, offering a hands-on exploration of leveraging DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) within Power BI to construct robust data scenarios. Throughout this course, created calculated columns, measures, and tables, and effectively displayed DAX measures using appropriate visuals. This course aims to make you proficient in writing DAX code to manipulate data and derive actionable insights.

## Project Objectives

* Master DAX Fundamentals: Learn to create calculated columns, measures, and tables using DAX
* Visualize Insights: Display DAX measures effectively using appropriate visuals in Power BI.

Project Content

## The hands-on project covers the following areas:

* Introduction to DAX: Get started with DAX, understand its importance, and learn how to apply it within Power BI.
* Creating Calculated Columns and Measures: Explore the process of creating calculated columns and measures to derive meaningful insights.
* Utilizing DAX Context: Understand the concept of context in DAX and learn how to use it effectively to analyze data.
* Advanced DAX Techniques: Dive deeper into DAX with advanced techniques such as iterators, CALCULATE function, and variables.
* Time Intelligence Functions: Learn to use time intelligence functions in DAX to analyze data over time periods.
* Project Conclusion: Wrap up the project by applying learned techniques to solve real-world data scenarios.
